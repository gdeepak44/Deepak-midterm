         <h1>Publications</h1>
         <p>Albert Einstein's contributions to science are encapsulated in several landmark publications, particularly his Annus Mirabilis papers of 1905, which introduced the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, and established the Special Theory of Relativity with the iconic equation ùê∏=ùëöùëê¬≤. In 1915, he published the General Theory of Relativity, which redefined gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass, leading to profound implications for astrophysics and cosmology. His work on the field equations laid the groundwork for understanding the interactions of matter and energy in the universe. Additionally, Einstein's explorations of quantum mechanics, despite his skepticism about its interpretations, significantly influenced the field and spurred ongoing discussions in theoretical physics. Collectively, these publications revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental laws governing the universe.</p>

                Albert Einstein had a deep passion for playing the violin, often using it as a means to relax and find inspiration during his demanding scientific pursuits. He found solace in music, particularly enjoying the works of composers like Mozart and Bach, whose intricate melodies resonated with his analytical mind.
